# Project Status

## Date

2026-06-18

## Purpose

This document records the current project state so the next developer or coding agent can continue Scripture Engine work in a new session without relying on conversation history.

`docs/ROADMAP/` did not exist before this update. It was created because `docs/DECISIONS/` is reserved for ADRs, while this document set records operational status, current implementation state, and immediate next tasks.

## Required Session Start

Before any future code or documentation change, read:

1. `AGENTS.md`
2. `docs/DEVELOPMENT_CONSTITUTION.md`
3. `docs/PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE.md`
4. Relevant ADRs under `docs/DECISIONS/`

Then run:

```bash
git rev-parse --show-toplevel
git status
find . -maxdepth 5 -type d | sort
```

Conversation memory is not enough. Documentation plus filesystem inspection is required every session.

## Current Phase Summary

Current phase:

```txt
Phase 5C - Original Language Importer Design
```

Status:

```txt
Ready To Begin
```

Completed phase:

```txt
Scripture Foundation, Search Layer, Reader Layer, Reader UX Polish, and Phase 5B Original Language Data Layer
```

Active objective:

```txt
Design the original-language importer workflow before any source dataset import.
```

Next task:

```txt
Phase 5C - Original Language Importer Design.
```

Blocked items:

```txt
STEP_TAHOT and STEP_TAGNT exact local source files or header/sample excerpts are not yet available. Source-specific normalizer implementation and OriginalLanguageImportService implementation are blocked until approved source headers, sample rows, license/attribution text, Greek edition filtering, Hebrew versification mapping, prefix/suffix token modeling, and sourceRef strategy are confirmed.
```

Current phase boundary:

```txt
Phase 5B Original Language Data Layer implementation is complete. Phase 5C must begin with importer design, source file inspection, header verification, import mapping, batch validation, dry-run design, and verification report design. It must not begin with actual STEP, OSHB, SBLGNT, or other dataset import.
```

Phase 5A source recommendation:

```txt
Hebrew primary source candidate: STEP Bible TAHOT
Hebrew secondary validation/reference: OSHB
Greek primary source candidate: STEP Bible TAGNT
Greek reference text: SBLGNT
MorphGNT: not a primary source before ShareAlike review
OpenGNT: not the first production source because of provenance/license complexity
```

## Phase 5 Entry Criteria

Next major phase:

```txt
Phase 5 - Original Language Foundation
```

Phase 5 entry sequence:

```txt
Phase 5A - Source and Schema Analysis
Phase 5B - Original Language Schema Foundation
Phase 5C - Import Foundation
Phase 5D - Read API Foundation
```

Phase 5 rules:

- Original Language data must not extend `wcm_bible_verses`.
- Original Language data belongs in separate custom tables.
- Core tables are `wcm_original_terms` and `wcm_original_word_occurrences`.
- Future related tables include `wcm_hebrew_letters`, `wcm_word_letter_breakdowns`, `wcm_pictographic_observations`, and `wcm_scripture_relationships`.
- The canonical connection point is `book_id + chapter + verse`.
- Strong's numbers are term-level fields such as `H7225` and `G3056`.
- Morphology is occurrence-level data.
- `wcm_scripture_relationships` is a discovery/ranking graph, not authoritative occurrence storage.
- Original Language import must use a dedicated importer, not direct reuse of the KRV verse importer.
- Source license and provenance must be verified before OSHB, SBLGNT, or other source imports.
- Source license and provenance must also be verified before STEP Bible, MorphGNT, OpenGNT, or other source imports.
- Original Language data must not be bundled into the frontend.
- Schema implementation, importer implementation, dataset import, and UI implementation remain out of scope until Phase 5A gates are complete.

Phase 5B entry requirements:

- Confirm exact STEP TAHOT and STEP TAGNT files and field headers.
- Document license and attribution text.
- Decide Greek edition filtering.
- Decide Hebrew versification handling.
- Decide prefix and suffix token modeling.
- Decide Strong's normalization.
- Draft validation rules.

Phase 5B schema design review summary:

- Core schema remains limited to `wcm_original_terms` and `wcm_original_word_occurrences`.
- `wcm_bible_verses` must not be extended for original-language data.
- `wcm_scripture_relationships` remains a future discovery/ranking graph, not authoritative occurrence storage.
- `wcm_original_terms` stores lexical identity, including normalized lemma, base Strong's, STEP extended Strong's, root, gloss, and optional definition.
- `wcm_original_word_occurrences` stores source-specific canonical occurrences, including `source_dataset`, `source_ref`, `word_order`, `subword_order`, `token_type`, surface/normalized form, morphology, and grammar fields.
- Phase 5B does not add `version_id` to original-language occurrences.
- Next implementation preparation must finalize enum values, migration/rollback notes, validation rules, and then prepare schema work.

Phase 5B implementation gate summary:

- Enum and naming decisions are fixed in `docs/ROADMAP/ORIGINAL_LANGUAGE_FOUNDATION_PLAN.md`.
- Initial `source_dataset` values are `STEP_TAHOT` and `STEP_TAGNT`.
- Future `source_dataset` values are `OSHB`, `SBLGNT`, `MORPHGNT`, and `OPENGNT`.
- Phase 5B implementation is table creation only for `wcm_original_terms` and `wcm_original_word_occurrences`.
- Existing Bible tables, existing Bible APIs, and existing import pipeline behavior must not be changed during Phase 5B.
- Phase 5C importer work must not begin until validation rules are applied.

Phase 5B implementation complete:

```txt
SchemaInstaller original language tables: complete
OriginalTerm ValueObject: complete
OriginalWordOccurrence ValueObject: complete
OriginalTermValidator: complete
OriginalWordOccurrenceValidator: complete
OriginalTermRepository: complete
OriginalWordOccurrenceRepository: complete
```

Phase 5C next phase:

```txt
Phase 5C - Original Language Importer Design
```

Phase 5C is design-first. It must define source file inspection, source header verification, import mapping, batch validation, dry-run behavior, verification report shape, validator/service responsibilities, and repository usage before any importer implementation or dataset import.

Phase 5C importer design analysis summary:

- Existing KRV import flow is `MDB export -> generated JSON -> ImportRow -> KrvImportValidator -> VerseImportService -> BibleRepository::upsertVerse() -> verification`.
- Existing KRV import does not include a true dry-run mode.
- Original Language import must add a stronger dry-run gate before persistence.
- Proposed Original Language flow is `Source file -> Source Inspection -> Source Metadata / License Gate -> Header / Shape Validation -> Row Normalization -> Batch Validation -> Dry-run Report -> Explicit Approval -> Term Persistence -> Occurrence Persistence -> Verification Report`.
- Dry-run must inspect, normalize, validate, build identity keys, optionally simulate read-only repository matching, produce counts and issues, and perform zero writes.
- `OriginalLanguageImportService` must default to dry-run behavior until implementation receives explicit approval.
- Phase 5C-6 header mapping analysis found no local STEP_TAHOT or STEP_TAGNT source files.
- `docs/data-sources/` currently contains KRV-related files only.
- Plugin tools currently contain KRV tooling only.
- STEP_TAHOT and STEP_TAGNT exact headers are not confirmed.
- `StepTahotNormalizer`, `StepTagntNormalizer`, and `OriginalLanguageImportService` must not be implemented until approved local source files or header/sample excerpts are provided and inspected.

Still prohibited:

- Actual STEP TAHOT or STEP TAGNT import.
- OSHB import.
- SBLGNT import.
- Public original-language API.
- Original-language UI, Interlinear UI, Strong's page, or Word Study UI.

Detailed Phase 5 plan:

```txt
docs/ROADMAP/ORIGINAL_LANGUAGE_FOUNDATION_PLAN.md
```

## Current Bible Lookup API

Current endpoint:

```txt
/wp-json/wcm/v1/bible/{version}/{book}/{chapter}/{verse}
```

Example:

```txt
/wp-json/wcm/v1/bible/KRV/genesis/1/1
```

Implementation structure:

- `src/Core/Plugin.php` registers API setup on `rest_api_init`.
- `src/Api/ApiRegistrar.php` calls `BibleController()->registerRoutes()`.
- `src/Api/BibleController.php` registers the lookup route.
- `BibleController` sanitizes and validates request parameters.
- `BibleController` uses `BibleRepository` for data access.
- `BibleRepository` uses `getVersionByCode`, `getBookBySlug`, and `getVerse` to query custom Bible tables.

## Current Bible Chapter API

Current endpoint:

```txt
/wp-json/wcm/v1/bible/{version}/{book}/{chapter}
```

Example:

```txt
/wp-json/wcm/v1/bible/KRV/genesis/1
```

Implementation structure:

- `src/Api/BibleController.php` registers the chapter route.
- `BibleController` sanitizes and validates version, book slug, and chapter params.
- `BibleController` uses `BibleRepository::getChapterVerses()` for chapter verse retrieval.
- The endpoint returns one chapter only and does not return a full Bible dataset.

## Current Book Metadata API

Current endpoint:

```txt
/wp-json/wcm/v1/books/{version}/{book}
```

Example:

```txt
/wp-json/wcm/v1/books/KRV/genesis
```

The endpoint returns book metadata used by the Reader for chapter boundary navigation:

```json
{
  "translation": "KRV",
  "book": "genesis",
  "name": "창세기",
  "chapter_count": 50
}
```

## Current Reader UX Status

The Reader now supports:

- Verse Anchor Navigation.
- Active Verse Highlight.
- Chapter Boundary Navigation.
- Bible Reader default scripture spacing/style standard.

Confirmed chapter boundary navigation examples:

- Genesis 1 previous is disabled.
- Genesis 50 next goes to Exodus 1.
- Malachi 4 next goes to Matthew 1.
- Matthew 1 previous goes to Malachi 4.
- Revelation 22 next is disabled.

Bible Reader default design standard:

```txt
docs/ROADMAP/BIBLE_READER_DESIGN_STANDARD.md
```

Current applied Reader spacing/style:

```txt
Verse list: ol gap-0
Verse row: py-0.5, scroll-mt-24, per-verse ids such as id="v16"
Verse text: leading-7
Active highlight: bg-blue-50, border-blue-200, rounded-lg, hover:bg-blue-100
Active verse number: text-blue-700
```

Design intent:

- Preserve a continuous Bible-like reading flow.
- Minimize artificial vertical spacing between verses.
- Maintain mobile readability.
- Highlight search-result destination verses with a subtle blue tone.
- Do not use strong yellow or red active verse highlights by default.
- Treat the Reader as scripture text density, not general blog article spacing.

Current applied spacing change:

```txt
Before: ol gap-4, verse row py-1, leading-8
After:  ol gap-0, verse row py-0.5, leading-7
```

Verified Reader spacing/style state:

```txt
typecheck passed
lint passed
build passed
git diff --check passed
```

## Current Scripture Source Structure

Current relevant plugin paths:

```txt
backend/app/public/wp-content/plugins/wcm-core/src/Scripture/Import/
backend/app/public/wp-content/plugins/wcm-core/src/Scripture/Repositories/
backend/app/public/wp-content/plugins/wcm-core/src/Scripture/ValueObjects/
backend/app/public/wp-content/plugins/wcm-core/src/Api/BibleController.php
backend/app/public/wp-content/plugins/wcm-core/src/Api/ApiRegistrar.php
backend/app/public/wp-content/plugins/wcm-core/src/Scripture/Repositories/BibleRepository.php
backend/app/public/wp-content/plugins/wcm-core/src/Search/.gitkeep
```

`src/Search/` currently contains only `.gitkeep`. No search implementation exists there.

## Current Bible Storage Notes

Production Scripture data belongs in custom tables:

```txt
wcm_bible_versions
wcm_bible_books
wcm_bible_verses
```

ADR-0009 mentions a future `FULLTEXT KEY text_search (text)`, but the current `SchemaInstaller.php` `wcm_bible_verses` schema does not include a `FULLTEXT` index. Do not make the first Bible Search API depend on `FULLTEXT`.

## Validation State

Before this document update:

- `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` returned `/Users/donmini/Local Sites/wordcovenantministry`.
- `git status` was clean.
- Actual filesystem inspection confirmed the official plugin path and the non-official `backend/wcm-core/` directory.
